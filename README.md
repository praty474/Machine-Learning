| 1   | Handwritten Digit Recognition System | This project involves building a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch, trained on the MNIST dataset. The system uses a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). The project includes loading and visualizing data, defining the MLP architecture, training the model using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and evaluating its performance on
