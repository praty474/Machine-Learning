    <th >:Handwritten Digit Recognition System</th>
    <th >:This project involves building a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch,       trained on the MNIST dataset. The system uses a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). The project includes loading and visualizing data, defining the MLP architecture, training the model using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and evaluating its performance on unseen test data. It demonstrates the application of deep learning in image classification tasks and showcases how neural networks can learn complex patterns from raw pixel data to make accurate predictions.</th>
